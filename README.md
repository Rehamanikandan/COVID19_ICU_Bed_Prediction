# COVID19_ICU_Bed_Prediction
Using publicly-available patient clinical data, our goal is to use maching learning and statistical modeling methods (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, histogram-based gradient boost, and deep neural networks) to analyze COVID ICU patient demographics and predict whether a patient will need ICU care during their COVID-related stay in the hospital.
